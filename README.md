<h1>Collaborate with Davide!</h1><h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Meteor Fort is a captivating 2D simulation and resource management game that challenges players to construct shelters and survive relentless meteor showers. Set in an apocalyptic world, players must navigate through peaceful and hazardous phases, strategically deploying resources to fortify their base. The ultimate goal is to protect the central block from destruction, using a mix of defensive structures and facilities that unlock new building options.
</p>
<p>As architects of their own survival, players must balance the construction of defensive barriers with the development of facilities that can enhance their capabilities and unlock new technologies. Each building not only serves a unique purpose, such as bolstering defenses or advancing technological progress but also presents opportunities for upgrades that provide critical advantages against the meteor onslaught.
